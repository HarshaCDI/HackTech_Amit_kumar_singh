I hope this message finds you well. This is Amit Kumar Singh, and I am submitting my project for the HackTech competition. You can find the complete code on my GitHub repository: https://github.com/itheaks/HackTech_Final.

I've organized the code in a way that makes it easy to navigate. For additional clarity, there's a dedicated folder labeled "Just for Reference" where you can find an IPython notebook (ipynb file). Feel free to explore it to address any questions or concerns you may have.

Thank you for considering my submission. I'm excited about the opportunity and look forward to your feedback.
