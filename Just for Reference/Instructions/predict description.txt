The predict Python script appears to be an implementation for real-time object detection and tracking using YOLO (You Only Look Once) for detection and DeepSort for object tracking. The script integrates YOLO for detection and DeepSort for tracking to identify and track objects in video streams or image sequences. Additionally, the script includes functionality to estimate the speed of tracked objects and count the number of objects entering and leaving a specified region.

## Key Points
1. Import Statements: The necessary libraries and modules are imported, including `hydra`, `torch`, `cv2`, `numpy`, and others.

2. Configuration and Initialization:
   - The script uses Hydra for configuration, allowing the user to customize various parameters through command-line arguments or configuration files.
   - The DeepSort tracker is initialized with configurations loaded from a YAML file.

3. Utility Functions:
   - Several utility functions are defined for tasks such as converting bounding box coordinates, computing colors for labels, drawing borders, and calculating the direction between two points.
   - The `estimatespeed` function computes the speed of an object based on its location in consecutive frames.

4. Object Tracking Initialization:
   - The `init_tracker` function initializes the DeepSort tracker using configurations from the provided YAML file.

5. Drawing Functions:
   - Functions like `UI_box` and `draw_boxes` are implemented for drawing bounding boxes, labels, and object trails on images.

6. Intersection and Direction Functions:
   - The script includes functions for determining intersection between two line segments and calculating the direction of an object based on its movement.

7. Main Predict Function:
   - The `predict` function is the main entry point of the script. It initializes the tracker, loads the YOLO model, and processes the input stream for object detection and tracking.

8. Object Counting and Speed Estimation:
   - The script counts the number of vehicles entering and leaving a region of interest. It also estimates the speed of the tracked objects.

9. Output Display:
   - The script displays the output with annotated bounding boxes, object labels, and trails. Object count and average speed are displayed on the output frames.

10. Usage of DeepSort and YOLO:
    - The script uses DeepSort for object tracking and YOLO for object detection. The integration allows for more robust tracking of objects in video streams.

## How speed estimation is working 

The speed estimation code in the provided script calculates the speed of tracked objects based on their movement between consecutive frames. The estimation is performed using the Euclidean distance traveled by the object in pixels and converting it to speed in kilometers per hour. Here's how the speed estimation code works:

1. Euclidean Distance Calculation:
   - The function `estimatespeed(Location1, Location2)` calculates the Euclidean distance between two points in pixels. These points represent the center of an object in consecutive frames.

   ```python
   d_pixel = math.sqrt(math.pow(Location2[0] - Location1[0], 2) + math.pow(Location2[1] - Location1[1], 2))
   ```

2. Pixels per Meter (ppm):
   - A constant `ppm` (pixels per meter) is defined to convert the distance in pixels to distance in meters.

   ```python
   ppm = 8
   d_meters = d_pixel / ppm
   ```

3. Time Constant:
   - A time constant (`time_constant`) is defined to convert the distance traveled to speed in kilometers per hour. This constant is set to 153.6, where 15 represents the number of frames per second.

   ```python
   time_constant = 15  3.6
   ```

4. Speed Calculation:
   - The speed of the object is calculated using the formula: `speed = distance / time`.

   ```python
   speed = d_meters  time_constant
   ```

5. Rounding and Return:
   - The calculated speed is rounded to an integer value and returned.

   ```python
   return int(speed)
   ```

The `estimatespeed` function is then used within the object tracking logic to estimate and display the speed of tracked objects. The speed information is integrated into the annotated output, providing additional insights into the behavior of the tracked objects. The calculated speed is displayed along with the object label on the output frames.
